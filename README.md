# üìö Java and JUnit Exercises - Library Management, DNI Calculation, and Exception Handling

## üìÑ Description

This project contains the solution for three proposed exercises:

- **Exercise 1:** Create a Java class to manage a collection of books in a library, with functionalities such as adding, retrieving, inserting at a specific position, and removing books, ensuring the integrity of the collection through unit tests using JUnit.
- **Exercise 2:** Create a `CalculateDni` class that calculates the corresponding letter for a DNI number, along with a test class that validates its functionality using parameterized tests in JUnit.
- **Exercise 3:** Create a class that throws an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` and verify its correct behavior with a JUnit test.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

- Java 17
- JUnit 5
- Maven (dependency management)
- IntelliJ IDEA

## üìã Requirements

To run this project, you will need:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or higher
- Maven 3.6+ installed
- An IDE with Maven and JUnit 5 support
- Access to a terminal or command line

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Execution

Once the environment is set up, follow these steps to run the tests:

**Run all tests:**
- Open your terminal inside the project directory.
- Execute the tests with the following command:

   ```bash
           mvn test

This will run the tests for all developed classes (JUnit and AssertJ).

**Run a specific test:**

- From the IDE, locate a test class or method inside the src/test/java package.

- Right-click and select the option Run Test.

**Manual Execution:**

- If you want to manually run the main classes to see their functionality, navigate to the src/main/java package.

- Execute the corresponding classes from the IDE by clicking the Run button.
